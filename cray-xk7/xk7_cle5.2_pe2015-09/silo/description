<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href="http://silo.llnl.gov/">Silo</a> is a library for reading and
writing a wide variety of scientific data to binary disk files.  The
files Silo produces and the data within them can be easily shared and
exchanged between wholly independently developed applications running on
disparate computing platforms.  Consequently, Silo facilitates the
development of general purpose tools for processing scientific data.
One of the more popular tools that process Silo data files is the <a

visualization system.</p>

<p>Silo supports gridless (point) meshes, structured meshes,
unstructured-zoo and unstructured-arbitrary-polyhedral meshes, block
structured AMR meshes, constructive solid geometry (CSG) meshes,
piecewise-constant (e.g. zone-centered) and bi- and tri-linear (e.g.
node-centered) variables defined on the node, edge, face or volume
elements of meshes as well as the decomposition of meshes into arbitrary
subset hierarchies including materials and mixing materials.  In
addition, Silo supports a wide variety of other useful objects to
address various scientific computing application needs.  Although the
Silo library is a serial library, it has some key features which enable
it to be applied quite effectively and scalable in parallel.</p>

<p>Architecturally, the library is divided into two main pieces; an
upper-level application programming interface (API) and a lower-level
I/O implementation called a driver. Silo supports multiple I/O drivers,
the two most common of which are the HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5)
and PDB (Portable Data Base) drivers. Both of these drivers are available
with NICS provided Silo library.

<h2>Use</h2>

Silo is available as a <a href="/computing-resources/modules">module</a>. 
To use Silo, simply load its modulefile:
<pre>
module load silo
</pre>
The appropriate flags to compile and link with Silo are automatically
passed when programs are compiled with the 
<a href="/computing-resources/darter/compiling"> Cray compiler wrappers. </a>
