<h1>GROMACS</h1>

<p> Category: Science Apps-Molecular Dynamics

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">Gromacs</a> is a versatile package to 
perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate 
the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of 
particles.

<p>It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids 
that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is 
extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate 
simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological 
systems, e.g. polymers.

<p>
Further information on Gromacs can be found on 
<a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">Gromacs website.</a>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Access to the binaries, libraries, and data files are provided through  
<a href="/computing-resources/modules">module</a>. The modulefile for Gromacs 
sets up the necessary environmental variables for Gromacs and 
updates PATH to include Gromacs executables. All binaries except for mdrun 
are built to run on service nodes.  These may be used on login nodes and within 
<a href="/computing-resources/darter/running_jobs#batch-scripts">
batch scripts</a>.  The mdrun executables must be run on the compute nodes via 
aprun to run on parallel.

<p> Within the PBS script, all binaries except mdrun can be run as usual.  The 
mdrun binary must run on the compute nodes via aprun to run on parallel:
<pre>
module load gromacs
aprun -n [number of cores] -N [cores per node] (mdrun || mdrun_d) [mdrun options]
</pre>

This must be executed from user's scratch space in the 
<a href="/computing-resources/darter/file_systems">Lustre file systems</a>.
