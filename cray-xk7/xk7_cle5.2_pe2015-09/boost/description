<h1>Boost</h1>

<p> Category: Libraries-Communication 

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
<a href=http://www.boost.org>Boost</a> is a compilation of free peer-reviewed 
portable C++ source libraries.

<p>An emphasize is placed on libraries that work well with the C++ 
Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, 
and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license 
encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.

<p>The aim is to establish "existing practice" and provide reference 
implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual 
standardization. Ten Boost libraries are already included in the C++ 
Standards Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) and will be in the 
new C++0x Standard now being finalized. C++0x will also include several 
more Boost libraries in addition to those from TR1. More Boost libraries 
are proposed for TR2.

<p>Further information on Boost can be found on 
<a href="http://www.boost.org//"> Boost website. </a>


<h2>Use</h2>
Boost is available as a <a href="/computing-resources/modules">module</a>.
To use Boost, simply load its modulefile:
<pre>
module load boost
</pre>
If any Boost libraries is required for linking, it needs to be specified
explicitly. For example, to link with Boost filesystem library, specify
<pre>
CC mycode.cpp -lboost_fileystem -lboost_system
</pre>

Any other include and linking flags to point to the Boost location are 
automatically passed when programs are compiled with the 
<a href="/computing-resources/darter/compiling"> Cray compiler wrappers. </a>
