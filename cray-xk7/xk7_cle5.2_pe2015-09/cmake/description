<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> is a cross-platform, open-source
build system. CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package
software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake
generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
environment of your choice.
