With H5PY (and also NetCDF4), for some reason there is an extraneous option "-R" that gets passed 
by the build process. This causes GCC to choke with "unrecognized command line
option" error. The "R" flag is actually a linker flag set by Distutils, and
is used to pass the runtime library dirs to the linker. It's unsure why it's
passed here, however, the workaround is to edit the file setup.py in H5PY
and remove (comment out) line 169. This is done in rebuild_h5py (and rebuild_netcdf4).

During runtime, we'll depend on LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the system ld-config to
find the correct shared library for HDF5
